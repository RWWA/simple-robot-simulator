Basic robot simulator.
A robot is placed on the table using the command PLACE and then the placement / direction can be modified using LEFT, RIGHT and MOVE.

The current position and direction can be attained via the REPORT command. 

TODO:
Additional test functions. Current test function only checks coordinates to absolute conversion and comparison 
Switch to use vw for positioning for responsive functionality
